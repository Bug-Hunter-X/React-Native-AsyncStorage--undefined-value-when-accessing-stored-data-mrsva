This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when working with AsyncStorage in React Native applications. The bug arises from attempting to access data from AsyncStorage before the asynchronous operation completes.  The solution showcases the proper way to handle the asynchronous nature of AsyncStorage using promises or async/await to ensure data is available before usage, preventing undefined values and app crashes. The included example provides clear explanations and code samples to illustrate the problem and its resolution.
