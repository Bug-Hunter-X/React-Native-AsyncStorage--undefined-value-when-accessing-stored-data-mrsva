This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in React Native and you try to access the stored data before it has been fully retrieved.  The problem is that AsyncStorage's getItem method is asynchronous, meaning it doesn't return the data immediately; instead, it returns a Promise. If you try to use the data directly from getItem, you'll likely get undefined or null because the Promise hasn't resolved yet. This leads to unexpected behavior or crashes, especially if you rely on this data to render components or perform calculations.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage
AsyncStorage.getItem('myKey').then(value => {
  console.log(value); // value might be undefined or null
  this.setState({ myData: value });
});

console.log(this.state.myData); // This will almost certainly be undefined
```
